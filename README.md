# Game_of_Live
This repository have the code of the "Game of Live by Conway" or "Cellular Automata", made with python in Visual Studio Code (VSCO)

Well...this code have a lot of limitations beacuse my university only wants a game of live in 50x50 (Matrix of cells),
so... in the code, the line 8 have the limitation, only change that line to the numbers of cells that you want to have in the game, also, you can change the size, in line 7.

line 19 to 50: Just the Cells that i choice to start in One...in other words, live cells.

To run de code on vsco, (in my case) just open the console and search the directory o folder where you copy the code, in this point, use the name of the code with his extension ".py" and press enter, only the program stop when you close up the console.

maybe I update this code in the future...maybe.
